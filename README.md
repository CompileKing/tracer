Hello FFGL

This repository contains the VS2017 project files to build a single FFGL effect plugin, that does absolutely nothing.

Once compiled, it can be found in /binaries/x86/Debug.

It's main purpose is to be a starting point for a step by step explaination of FFGL. 
Each commit will add a bit more functionality, so the information presented is not too overwhelming.
