Hello FFGL

This repository contains the VS2017 and XCode project files to build a single FFGL effect plugin, that does absolutely nothing.

Once compiled, it can be found in /binaries/

It's main purpose is to be a step by step explaination of FFGL. I'm liberally sprinkling everything with comments.
Each commit will add a bit more functionality, so the information presented is not too overwhelming.

I will tag important commits. The idea is that each tagged commit is a new chapter of the tutorial. 
You can work your way through the tagged commits using your GIT client.
